 Networks Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected because of similar interests, hobbies, skills and sorts.
Networks can be found in all walks of life:
 A city&amp;rsquo;s public transportation system Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity Meeting and greeting your neighbours Postal systems for sending letters and parcels  But more specifically, in computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices.[HTTP&lpar;s&rpar;](https://unitarity.netlify.app/en/posts/http/)

HTTP&lpar;S&rpar; What is HTTP? &lpar;HyperText Transfer Protocol&rpar; HTTP is what&amp;rsquo;s used whenever you view a website, developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991. HTTP is the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc.[DNS](https://unitarity.netlify.app/en/posts/dns/)
Overview Extremely introductory data and definition regarding DNS and name resolution workings.
What is DNS? DNS &lpar;Domain Name System&rpar; provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers. Much like every house has a unique address for sending mail directly to it, every computer on the internet has its own unique address to communicate with it called an IP address. An IP address looks like the following 104.[Previse](https://unitarity.netlify.app/en/posts/previse/)

OSINT &amp;amp; The Digital Footprint OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence, information that can be obtained from free and public sources. Offensive teams commonly use OSINT to perform reconnaissance on a target, an individual, or a corporation. Agencies and law enforcement can also leverage OSINT to gather information.
OSINT may seem scary at first; where do I find this information? Will I get in trouble? No need to worry; most OSINT operations are straightforward using tools you are already familiar with on the clearnet.<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->
